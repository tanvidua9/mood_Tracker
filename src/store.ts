//Reducers must be pure so that for the same state and action they always return the same result, enabling predictable behavior, easy testing, and reliable Redux DevTools time travel.

//A reducer must be non-mutating because Redux relies on immutability to:
// Detect changes â€” it compares old and new state objects by reference. If you mutate, the reference stays the same, and Redux thinks nothing changed, therefore resfresh ni krega
